Confessions - Full MERN Stack WebApp that allows user's to submit and view confessional statements.

## Overview
Users can submit a single confession to view another user's anonymous post. In order to see a new confession, the user must submit another.

Viewing other confession-based websites online, there is a significant amount of abuse being posted. In order to combat malicious actors, the site was designed in a fashion that removes the satisfaction of any bad-actor posting. Posts are not viewed in a hierarchical fashion and the entirety of submissions cannot be viewed.

## Tech
Confessions employs a complete MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) tech stack.
The client is deployed using Vercel.
The server-side API is hosted via fly.io.
